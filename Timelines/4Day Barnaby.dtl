Smitty: Dude, that detective is like, back again.
Barnaby: He's not just a detective, he's my, well, friend?
MC: I think so.

MC: I've got some leads in my pocket, I think.
MC: Well, certainly by tomorrow I should be able to close the case.
Smitty: Dude, that's like, barely following due process.
Smitty: I mean, don't get me wrong, but, don't you gotta like, organize evidence, otherwise you'rejust judge, jury, and executioner,
MC: Please, I'm just judge and jury.
Smitty: Okay, dude, kind of whack if you ask me.

Barnaby: Want to play some Tetris?
