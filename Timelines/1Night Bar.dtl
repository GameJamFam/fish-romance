The bar has a classy ambience. You don't necessarily regret spending six hours organizing your paperclips, but it does put a serious crunch on your interview time. 
Besides that, you haven't even had time to sort your tchotchkes alphabetically yet. 
Best run through a few interviews and set back to the office, post haste. The bartender should be a good start.
