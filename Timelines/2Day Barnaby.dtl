You enter the residence hall. The stench of a thousand teenage boys who have yet to discover showers hits you in the nose like a brick.
Eyes watering, you make your way towards the room. Barnaby is inside, along with his roommate.

Smitty: Word.
Barnaby: So I'm not that great with, you know, making friends and all, but well,
Barnaby: Smitty actually just in recently enrolled me in his frat!
Smitty: Yeah.
Barnaby: Yeah it's pretty cool. It's, you know, it's a good way to meet people I think.
Barnaby: Anyway, Smitty's a lot more sociable than I am so I was --
Barnaby: Smitty, for some context MC here is trying to get to the bottom of who did who did that thing at the vent.
Smitty: Oh yeah ,that thing at the vent. Man, that's real bad. Real bad, man.
MC: I see. Tell me more.
MC: Have you heard anything about what happened? You wouldn't happen to know anything, would you?
Smitty: Man, what is knowledge? All I'm saying is\:
Smitty: Real bad for the town, real badman. Yeah, real bad indeed.
MC: ...
MC: At any rate. Thank you, Smitty, for all your help.
Smitty: No problem, I'll see you around dude.

Barnaby: Ah, so this is my dorm room.
MC: I like your gaming setup.
Barnaby: Thank you! Smitty, he's a bit of a character, but otherwise he's harmless.
MC: You don't think he's addicted to seaweed, do you?
Barnaby: Smitty? no he's on the up-and-up. At least, I think so.
Barnaby: I don't know. That the rush process was pretty intense, but I don't think Smitty would do anything like that.
MC: what'd you have to do for your rush?
Barnaby: Oh, you know. just run around town and egg the other fraternities house. Harmless pranks like that.
Barnaby: Oh, I shouldn't have admitted that, you're...
MC: No no, it's fine I can look the other way. As long as no one's made any complaints, at least.
Barnaby: Oh, thanks!
MC: So what did you do specifically?
Barnaby: Oh yeah, pranks like that. Nothing else. Anyway, you want to play some games?
MC: Sure.
