Eeliott: I'm telling you, Holly, the more I look at this thing, the less I think this rock rolled itself.
Eeliott: Or at the very least, someone clearly pushed it.
Eeliott: Look, you can even see chalk marks on here.
Hollandaise: I don't know, Eeliott, that seems unlikely, especially since it's so heavy.
Hollandaise: You'd have to get machinery up here. There's no other way.
Eeliott: But how would you power it?
Eeliott: You would almost need machinery hooked up to the vent itself in order to generate enough power to get this thing over the last hill.
Hollandaise: Yeah, at least now your bioluminescent art piece can be truly appreciated now that most places are dark.
Eeliott: Holly, I appreciate the looking on the brighter side of things, but come on now, that's too far.
Hollandaise: I'm just saying.
Hollandaise: You always wanted more eyes on your work, yeah?
Hollandaise: Look at the bright side.
