Eeliott: {Player.name}, I'm so glad you're here, there's something I'd like to show you.
Eeliott: It's my bioluminescence piece, it's, I think it's finally ready,
MC: My god, it's me.
Eeliott: Yeah, I'm so glad you're here to see it, like these past few days, with you coming around, it's really brought more attention to my art.
Eeliott: I think it's made people more aware of our role coexisting in an ecosystem, and I can't thank you enough for that.
MC: I really do appreciate it
MC: Thank you, Eeliott, that really means a lot to me.
